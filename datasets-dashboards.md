## R Forecasting 

- https://alhill.shinyapps.io/COVID19seir/

Other COVID-19 apps that we recommend:

-    https://benflips.shinyapps.io/nCovForecast/ - For tracking the growth rate of infections over time, comparing contries, and estimating the fraction of cases detected
-    https://mackgrenfell.com/forecaster/covid19 - Simulations simple exponential growth and compares to hospital capacity
-    http://gabgoh.github.io/COVID/index.html - Visualize the impact of intervention timing and strength on the reduction of cases
-   https://neherlab.org/covid19/ - Similar to this app, simulating epidemic dynamics and comparing to hospital capacity
