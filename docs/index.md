# [iTrack COVID](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid) Web App




With many open data-sets about COVID-19 and data science tools available, is the possible to build an Expert System that would help us to make decisions related to the risks associated with the spread of the pandemic in your community and around the globe? It was this question that drove the design of an interactive Web App, called iTrack COVID, available from: https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid.

The App reads data from Statistics Canada, Johns Hopkins University Global Coronavirus database and University of Toronto Coronavirus database, and finds automatically the areas of highest risk, according to the selected criteria, such as: daily speed (new cases a day), acceleration (change in speed a day), mortality rate, and growth (aka reproduction) rate. 

As opposed to majority of other Apps and websites that report COVID statistics averaged over large regions (e.g., over entire province or country), [iTrack COVID App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid) provides results at much finer scale - at municipality level. This can make a large difference for decision makers and residents of those muicipalities, as it is very common that, while *in average* the province is improving, there are muicipalities where the situation is actually deteriorating. It is therefore very important  to identify those municipalities, so that appropriate measures can be undertaken there. And this is what [iTrack COVID App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid)  does.


The App includes both local (city level) information for Canada and US, as well as global information for all countries around the globe, is compatible with mobile devices, and provides region specific URL short-cuts...

"This App provides LIVE updates on the situation with COVID-19 in Canada and other countries at the municipal level. The unique feature of the App is a fully automated *data science driven* approach for searching and identifying high-risk regions in the country. In addition, to searching by Total and New Cases, you can also search by Acceleration, which is change in new cases a day, and Growth Rate, also known as Reproduction Rate or Rt."
